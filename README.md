Make sure you set the API KEY in owasp-zap and configure in views.py
example - Lets run it as a background process and bind it to port 8080 (owasp-zap -daemon -port 8080 -host 0.0.0.0 -config api.key='your preferred key')
- Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection details in the configuration file.
